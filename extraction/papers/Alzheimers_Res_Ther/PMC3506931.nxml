Date of death was available for everyone including those eventually lost. Baseline variables included age, sex, race, disease severity, a calculated index of rate of initial cognitive decline from symptom onset to cohort entry (pre-progression rate or PPR), years of education, and medical comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to analyze the baseline and/or time dependent association in Mini-mental Status Exam (MMSE) severity, Physical Self Maintenance Scale (PSMS), Persistency Index (PI) of exposure to antipsychotic and antidementia drugs, and psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) with mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Baseline covariates significantly associated with increased survival were younger age (p = .0016), female sex (p = .0001), and a slower PPR (p &#x0003c; .0001).

Time-dependent changes in antipsychotic drug use, development of psychotic symptoms, antidementia drug use, and observed MMSE change were not predictive.

Antipsychotic drugs have also been linked to increased risk of death in older people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Estimating survival following the recognition of AD is an important health matter for patients and their families who must plan for medical care at the end of life. Estimating length of life is also important for predicting the impact of dementia on health-care resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Since 1993, five drugs have been marketed in the US for the treatment of AD (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, and memantine). Antidementia drugs have been proven to mitigate the symptoms of AD but their influence on long-term course and life span is not established. Recent observational studies suggest that cognitive and functional benefits continue over many years for patients who persist in their treatment, beyond the relatively short duration of benefit evident in clinical research trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Antidementia drugs are not thought to influence longevity, but there are conflicting reports in the literature. Several observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] found no relationship between the use of any antidementia drug regimen (cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine or both) and survival when users were compared with untreated patients. Two large cross-sectional studies that involved retrospective data analysis reported that the use of cholinesterase inhibitors versus no treatment significantly increased survival in nursing home patients. Both tacrine use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (hazard ratio = 0.76, confidence interval (CI) = 0.70 to 0.83) and donepezil use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (hazard ratio = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.83 to 0.95) were associated with significantly reduced mortality. This study evaluated a broad range of covariates suspected to influence survival and assessed the use of antidementia drugs in a time-dependent analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Informed consent was received from all patients involved in the study. The patients were evaluated at the Baylor College of Medicine Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Center. The study began in 1989 and enrolled 1,833 patients with dementia as of 31 December 2005 (censoring date). All members of this community-based cohort agreed to participate in a database approved by the institutional review board of the Baylor College of Medicine. Six hundred forty-one participants met the established criteria for probable AD as determined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and were included in this analysis. Vital status is obtained from the National Death Index every 6 months and allows calculation of survival time for all enrolled subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Exposure</title><p>Cumulative drug exposure to antidementia drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine or both) or antipsychotic drugs (typical or atypical) was determined from the onset of symptoms. The onset of first symptoms is estimated by a physician using a standardized algorithm to the nearest half-year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Start and stop dates of drug exposure are recorded at the first clinic visit by history obtained from the patient and caregiver along with a review of medical and pharmacy records. This information is updated at each return visit to the center. All periods on a given drug are summed in order to generate the cumulative drug exposure. Lapses in treatment or switching from one drug to another are recorded. To reconcile antidementia drug exposure that occurred by virtue of participation in a clinical research trial, we obtained the blinding data from those trials. No attempt was made to quantify the dose of medication or distinguish between drug regimens (for example, monotherapy or combination therapy with a cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine or use of any particular antipsychotic drug).</p></sec><sec><title>Covariates</title><p>Baseline variables were age, sex, race (white versus non-white), disease severity based upon Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], years of formal education, medical comorbidites present in the past or currently active (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, or cerebrovascular disease), and the pre-progression rate (PPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], a calculated rate of cognitive decline prior to enrollment. Patients with AD progress at intrinsically different rates, but little is known about factors that explain the variance. The PPR has prognostic value in classifying patients as rapid, intermediate, or slow progressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is calculated at the initial clinic visit by means of the following formula: (the MMSE score out of 30 - initial MMSE score) / physician's estimate of symptom duration (in years). Patients are stratified into slow (decline of 0 to 1.9 MMSE points per year), intermediate (decline of 2 to 4.9 MMSE points per year), or rapid (decline of at least 5 MMSE points per year) progressors.</p><p>We used a time-dependent mechanism to assess the impact of changes in cognition measured by the MMSE, basic activities of daily living measured by the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], time-dependent changes in the Persistency Index (PI) or exposure to antipsychotic and antidementia drugs, and the development of psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) on time to death. The PI is calculated as the total duration of drug treatment (in years) divided by the total duration of symptoms (in years) extended to the censoring date or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Only a few participants developed medical comorbidities following baseline evaluation and so it was not possible to use a time-dependent mechanism to assess this variable.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Time to death for all-cause mortality was evaluated by multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with stepwise selection process to evaluate baseline and time-dependent change in covariates or risk factors. All analyses were performed by using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Logistic regression was applied to determine the covariates significantly associated with survival (determined by a <italic>P </italic>value of not more than 0.05), and hazard ratios for significant covariates were determined in the final model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Median survival time among the 641 patients with probable AD following the onset of symptoms was 11.3 years (CI = 10.4 to 11.8), and there were 352 deaths. The mean (standard deviation) follow-up time after the baseline visit to censoring or death was 3.0 (1.94) years; overall, the patients in this cohort returned to the clinic for an average of 2.4 (1.64) visits. The cohort predominately was female (68%) and white (87%). Many participants were already using antidementia drugs prior to the initial visit (42.6%). The average baseline MMSE score was 19.5 (6.64), and the range was 0 to 30; the average baseline PSMS score was 7.9 (3.05), and the range was 6 to 25 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Population characteristics of patients with Alzheimer's disease</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Variable (n = 641)</th><th align="center">Value</th><th align="center">Percentage</th><th align="center">Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Age, years</td><td align="center">73.0 (8.50)</td><td/><td align="center">43-93</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Female</td><td/><td align="center">68</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Race (white versus non-white)</td><td/><td align="center">87</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Education, years</td><td align="center">14.0 (3.56)</td><td/><td align="center">0-29</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Duration of symptoms before initial visit, years</td><td align="center">3.7 (2.29)</td><td/><td align="center">0.5-13</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Follow-up time from baseline to censoring or death, years</td><td align="center">3.0 (1.94)</td><td/><td align="center">0.7-13.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total number of follow-up visits to the clinic</td><td align="center">2.4 (1.64)</td><td/><td align="center">2-11</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MMSE score</td><td align="center">19.5 (6.64)</td><td/><td align="center">0-30</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PSMS score</td><td align="center">7.9 (3.05)</td><td/><td align="center">6-25</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Using antipsychotics drugs</td><td align="center">221</td><td align="center">34.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Using antidementia drugs</td><td align="center">554</td><td align="center">86.4</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Pre-progression rate</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Slow</td><td align="center">192</td><td align="center">30.0</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Moderate</td><td align="center">297</td><td align="center">46.3</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Fast</td><td align="center">152</td><td align="center">23.7</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Experiencing hallucination</td><td align="center">291</td><td align="center">45.4</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Experiencing delusions</td><td align="center">371</td><td align="center">57.9</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Continuous variables are presented as mean (standard deviation).

This figure may overestimate the length of survival in AD since individuals with rapidly progressive illness may die before they obtain a diagnosis. Median survival time in a Canadian study that evaluated survival from the onset of symptoms of dementia found that patients with AD had a 3.1-year median survival time after correction for the so-called length bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but the population was much older than ours; the average age was 83.8 (7.03) years. Survival from onset of symptoms was not modified by white or non-white race or education. All non-white races/ethnicities were reported to have a survival advantage following diagnosis over white patients in a large retrospective analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but the present study may have been underpowered to detect small differences in survival between these two groups. Survival in AD in a study of incident cases also found no differences in mortality by race or ethnicity but did report that a history of diabetes or hypertension was associated with a shorter life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], whereas our study did not confirm the risk of death due to these comorbidities (as discussed below). Our results were in agreement with those of another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that evaluated cognitive decline and survival in patients with AD and found no relationship between survival and educational attainment.</p><p>Our results confirm previous findings that some of the factors that predict survival in the general population are also relevant to AD; specifically, several of the main predictors for survival in AD are age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] along with an impairment or decline in functional abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Every 1-point increase on the PSMS, which measures the ability to perform basic activities of daily living and is scored on a scale of 0 to 30 points, was associated with an increased risk of death of 10% per year.</p><p>Like the investigators in a large population study that was performed in the UK and that used multivariable adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we found that disease severity is not associated with survival. Neither disease severity at baseline nor time-dependent changes in the MMSE score influenced survival. However, the PPR indicates the rate at which a patient declines following the onset of symptoms, presumably an intrinsic disease progression rate, and was significantly associated with increased risk of death. We previously reported that patients who are slow progressors have significantly reduced mortality compared with fast progressors (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.91, <italic>P </italic>= 0.024), but the mortality between intermediate and fast progressors did not reach significance in that study (hazard ratio = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.15, <italic>P </italic>= 0.24) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The present study suggests that the survival advantage associated with the PPR is on a continuum and not limited to those with slowest disease progression.</p><p>It is often presumed that medical comorbidities should also influence survival with AD. Diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, and cerebrovascular disease at baseline did not influence survival in this cohort. This result was similar to that of another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and could be a consequence of length bias or the fact that patients with severe medical comorbidity may never seek treatment for dementia. The study which did find that these comorbidites reduced survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] did not examine the other covariates used in our analysis.</p><p>Although studies suggest that atypical antipsychotic drugs increase risk of death in older patients with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the use of traditional or typical agents is associated with even greater risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we could not replicate these findings in our outpatient-based sample. Time-dependent changes in the use of antipsychotic drugs or psychotic symptoms (hallucinations or delusions) did not impact survival in this analysis. Our results are consistent with those of a cross-sectional study with longitudinal follow-up, in which neither the use of antipsychotic medications nor the development of psychosis increased risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Psychosis was reported to be associated with a more rapid disease progression or functional decline in another study but again did not increase risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our results call into question the suggestion that antipsychotic drugs prescribed to patients with dementia will shorten their life span, but an important difference may be that most of our patients lived in the community rather than in nursing homes. Additionally, our patients are treated with low doses of antipsychotic drugs, which may not confer the same risk as higher doses included in prior studies.</p><p>The majority of caregivers for patients with AD identify quality of life and preservation of patient cognition and function as being the most important benefits to be derived from therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Previous pivotal drug studies have demonstrated drug-placebo benefits, and observational studies support the long duration of these benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our findings support the view that patients with mild, moderate, or severe AD can be treated without the worry that such treatment will prolong life in the most debilitated stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this large AD cohort, survival is influenced by age, sex, and a calculable intrinsic rate of decline. Disease severity at baseline, vascular risk factors, and years of education did not influence time to death.

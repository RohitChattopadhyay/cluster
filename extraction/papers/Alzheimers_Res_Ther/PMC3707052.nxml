Because amyloid plaques appear before the onset of clinically-defined dementia symptoms, neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive impairment are hypothesized to be a downstream consequence of &#x003b2;-amyloid (A&#x003b2;) peptide dysregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A&#x003b2; peptides are small fragments cleaved from a much larger integral membrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In the AD cascade, APP is cleaved initially by &#x003b2;-secretase (BACE), leaving the C99 fragment in the membrane, which is then cleaved by gamma-secretase, an aspartyl protease complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Gamma-secretase continues to make sequential cleavages every three to four amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], resulting in A&#x003b2; fragments ranging in size from 49 to fewer than 34 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Much of the focus in AD research has been on A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>, since it has been shown to be the most amyloidogenic and neurotoxic fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More recently, A&#x003b2;<sub>43 </sub>has also been shown to have these detrimental properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To test the hypothesis that lowering A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>levels may slow the progression of or prevent AD, multiple amyloid-targeted therapeutic approaches have been developed and moved into human clinical trials. These include A&#x003b2; clearance-directed immunotherapies as well as inhibitors of BACE or gamma-secretase enzyme activities, both of which are required for A&#x003b2; production.</p><p>To prevent the production of these neurotoxic A&#x003b2; peptides, researchers have focused on developing small molecule inhibitors of BACE and gammasecretase. In preclinical animal models, <italic>in vivo </italic>administration of gamma secretase inhibitors led to severe side effects, including an increased number of goblet cells in the intestine and decreased intrathymic differentiation and lymphocyte development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These adverse events were found to be the result of inhibiting gamma-secretase's ability to process other substrates, specifically NOTCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which is critical for cell development and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Similar adverse events were also observed in recent clinical trials of semagacestat and avagacestat, further suggesting that complete inhibition of gamma-secretase is not a viable approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Much remains unknown about the approach to prevent A&#x003b2; production through BACE inhibition, as a subset of those molecules are currently in human clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The discovery of multiple structural classes of compounds that modulate gamma-secretase activity, instead of inhibiting it, offers the potential promise of avoiding the mechanism-based adverse events observed with gamma-secretase inhibitors. Gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) are observed to decrease the production of the more amyloidogenic A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>peptide, while preserving total A&#x003b2; levels and sparing gamma-secretase cleavage of the other substrates, such as NOTCH. Modulation allows the initial cleavage of substrates, but alters the processivity of the enzyme by shifting the production of A&#x003b2; peptides to the shorter, non-amyloidgenic forms without affecting the total level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A first generation GSM, Flurizan from Myraid Genetics was tested in a Phase 3 trial. However, the compound is a weak modulator (IC<sub>50 </sub>= 250 &#x003bc;M), lacks brain penetration, and produced side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The compound failed to show efficacy, and development was halted in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Since the approach of gamma modulation has not been adequately tested in humans, it is still believed that a more potent, drug-like compound could be a viable therapeutic approach.</p><p>Here we describe the <italic>in vivo </italic>pharmacology for a novel series of compounds, represented by SPI-1865 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All compounds within the series that have been tested <italic>in vivo </italic>show a PK/PD relationship in rodents as robust as SPI-1865 (data not shown). The compound scaffold is derived from an initial hit, a triterpene glycoside (SPI-014), which was discovered through a screen of a natural products library for compounds with GSM properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Following a comprehensive and focused research effort, compounds like SPI-1865 were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The compounds in this series, including SPI-1865, have a novel and proprietary structure, as well as the unique effect on the A&#x003b2; profile of lowering both A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>38</sub>, without effecting A&#x003b2;<sub>40 </sub>in cellular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Using immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry (IP/MS) analysis of conditioned media from Satori compound-treated versus control 2B7 cells, it was observed that the total A&#x003b2; levels are maintained with concomitant lowering of A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and increases in A&#x003b2;<sub>37 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>39 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, since increasing substrate levels do not result in an IC<sub>50 </sub>shift, it is likely that SPI-1865 binds to the gamma-secretase complex as do other GSMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] instead of the APP substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the studies described here, the effects of SPI-1865 on A&#x003b2;<sub>38</sub>, A&#x003b2;<sub>40 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>in both wild-type and transgenic animals were examined. The A&#x003b2; changes observed in these studies reflect the changes observed in our cellular systems, resulting in a decrease of both A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>in all three models, suggesting that SPI-1865 maintains its GSM properties <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>General structure of Satori gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs), including SPI-1865</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="alzrt173-1"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Test compound</title><p>SPI-1865 was prepared in a manner as described in Bronk <italic>et al</italic>., patent WO2011109657 A1 20110909.

Frozen hemispheres were weighed into tared homogenization tubes (MP Biomedicals#6933050 for rat; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and (Simport#T501-4AT; Simport, Beloeil, Qc, Canada) containing one 5-mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen#69989 for mouse). For every gram of brain, 10 mLs of either 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (wild-type rat and mouse) or 0.2% diethyl amine in 50 mM NaCl (transgenic mouse) was added to the brain-containing tubes on wet ice. Rat hemispheres were homogenized for one minute and mouse hemispheres were homogenized for 30 seconds at the 6.5 setting using the FastPrep-24 Tissue and Cell homogenizer (MP Biomedicals#116004500). Homogenates were rocked for 2 hrs at 4&#x000b0;C, then pre-cleared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for one hour at 4&#x000b0;C. Pre-cleared wild-type rat and mouse homogenates were concentrated over solid phase extraction (SPE) columns (Oasis HLB 96-well SPE plate 30 &#x003bc;m, Waters#WAT058951; Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Briefly, SPE columns were prepared by wetting with 1 mL of 100% methanol followed by dH<sub>2</sub>0 using vacuum to pull liquids through. Brain homogenates were then added to the prepared columns (1.0 mL from rat and 0.7 mL from wild-type mouse). Columns were washed twice with 1 mL of 10% methanol followed by two 1 mL washes with 30% methanol. Labeled eluent collection tubes (Costar cluster tubes #4413; Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) were placed under SPE columns and samples were eluted under very mild vacuum with 300 &#x003bc;L of 2% NH<sub>4</sub>OH/90% methanol.

Films were resuspended in 150 &#x003bc;L of Meso Scale Discovery (MSD, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) blocking buffer (1% BSA in MSD wash buffer) for one hour at room temperature with occasional vortexing. Transgenic mouse plasma (50 &#x003bc;L) was extracted in 500 &#x003bc;L of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride briefly at room temperature and then 450 &#x003bc;L was concentrated over SPE columns and dried to films as described above. Transgenic plasma films were resuspended in 225 &#x003bc;L of MSD blocking buffer. Pre-cleared transgenic mouse brain homogenates were diluted and neutralized as follows. A volume of 45 &#x003bc;L of pre-cleared transgenic mouse brain homogenates were diluted into 450 &#x003bc;L of blocking buffer and were neutralized with 5 &#x003bc;L of 0.5 M Tris pH 6.8.

SPI-1865 has a delayed Tmax and half-life in excess of 24 hrs following a single oral dose in rats (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Based on this profile, compound efficacy was examined using a single oral dose and tissues were harvested 24 hrs post dose. Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered an oral dose of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg SPI-1865 in a formulation of 10/20/70 of ethanol/cremaphor/water.

In Sprague-Dawley rats, the compound effectively lowered A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>levels following a single dose. With once a day dosing for six days, the A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>response was improved. Given that the half-life of SPI-1865 is greater than 24 hrs in the rat, improved efficacy was anticipated, since accumulation of compound in the plasma occurs following multiple days of dosing. However, the compound levels in the brain did not show the same degree of accumulation with multiple dosing, even though brain efficacy was improved. Based on multiple <italic>in vitro </italic>studies (data not shown), SPI-1865 is not a substrate for transporters nor does it cause CYP induction, either of which may lower the brain exposure. Together these data suggest that sustained exposure to SPI-1865 levels over multiple days contributes to enhanced efficacy of the compound to modulate gamma-secretase.</p><p>SPI-1865 was next examined for efficacy in 3-month-old, female Tg2576 mice. These mice produce human APP with the SWE mutation via the prion promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The transgene expression has been shown to be highest in the brain, but the transgene is also expressed in peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The peripheral production of A&#x003b2; in the Tg2576 mouse may influence the effects of SPI-1865 on brain A&#x003b2; versus plasma A&#x003b2; levels when comparing efficacy in transgenic and wild-type models.</p><p>Data from this study indicate that SPI-1865 readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, as evident in the levels of SPI-1865 measured in brain. The ability to measure efficacy in both the brain and plasma compartments in the transgenic mice allows us to probe whether total or free concentrations of compound drives efficacy. If total compound were responsible for efficacy in both tissue compartments, one would expect to see similar decreases in A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>in both the plasma and brain in the Tg2576, as the exposure in each compartment is similar. However, what is observed is a significantly improved lowering of A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>in the plasma relative to the brain. The most likely reason for the difference in efficacy between the two compartments is the level of free drug available in the plasma versus the brain. The level of compound binding in the plasma is 97.6% based on <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, leaving 2.4% free compound to interact with gamma-secretase. This is a significantly higher free fraction than the estimates for free fraction in the brain, where protein binding was measured at approximately 99.9%. When the average free fraction for each compartment is compared for the 90 mg/kg dose (brain<sub>total </sub>= 6.9 &#x003bc;M; plasma<sub>total </sub>= 6.4 &#x003bc;M), the plasma free-fraction levels of 153 nM exceed the <italic>in vitro </italic>IC<sub>50 </sub>of SPI-1865 (106 &#x000b1; 19 nM) and plasma A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>levels were lowered by 76 &#x000b1; 2%. The average brain free-fraction was only 6.9 nM, below the IC<sub>25 </sub>of 33 &#x000b1; 18 nM, and while a trend toward lowering of A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>was observed, it was not statistically significant<sub>. </sub>It is important to note the high variability of A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>measurement in the Tg2576 brains impacted the ability to see statistically significant decreases in brain A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>, even with a large number of animals per group (<italic>n </italic>= 20) and may affect our determination of free versus bound in the brain. Moreover, it is challenging to get an accurate measure of free concentration in brain when brain protein binding is greater than 99%. Even in the face of these technical challenges, the data presented here indicate that the plasma free-fraction of SPI-1865 correlates most closely with A&#x003b2; lowering in that compartment.</p><p>In the Tg2576 study, the changes in CSF A&#x003b2; levels were examined along with the plasma and brain. While treatment with SPI-1865 trended towards a decrease in brain A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and significantly lowered the plasma levels of A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>at the three highest doses tested, in the CSF the A&#x003b2; peptide levels were not significantly decreased. There are several possible explanations for the lack of a significant effect. The high variability in CSF A&#x003b2; measurements within this study may mask an effect on the A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>levels. In addition, the timing of sample collection relative to dosing may have been more optimal to assess plasma changes than to assess changes in brain and CSF A&#x003b2; levels<sub>.</sub></p><p>In wild-type mice, we further investigated the <italic>in vivo </italic>activity of SPI-1865 once steady state plasma levels were achieved. With a half-life of 8 hrs and a Tmax of approximately 4 hrs in the mouse (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), a six-day BID dosing study was designed to measure exposure and A&#x003b2; levels 6 hrs post dose, allowing maximal efficacy to be observed by capturing exposures near the maximal plasma concentration and providing nearly continuous engagement with the enzyme. This is different from the Tg2576 study where once-a-day dosing was utilized for six days and samples were harvested 24 hrs post dose. In this study, there was much less variability of A&#x003b2; levels among animals than the Tg2576 mice and six days of BID dosing resulted in a significant lowering of brain A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>at all doses compared to vehicle-dosed animals. Plasma and CSF levels were not measured in this experiment. When we examined plasma free-fraction versus efficacy, an A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>lowering of 22 &#x000b1; 4%, 39 &#x000b1; 3% and 47 &#x000b1; 2% occurred as the doses increased, and these changes corresponded with free plasma concentrations of 82, 105 and 182 nM, respectively. Together, this wild-type mouse study in combination with the Tg2576 model and rat data, demonstrate the ability of SPI-1865 to lower both A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub><italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together the data shown in these studies demonstrate that SPI-1865 is an efficacious gamma-modulator <italic>in vivo </italic>(all <italic>in vivo </italic>data are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This is demonstrated in multiple rodent models using a single dose, multiple-day dosing or a multiple-day BID dosing regimen. These data indicate that SPI-1865 is orally bioavailable, brain penetrant, and has a different A&#x003b2; profile from other GSMs, both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. SPI-1865 lowers A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>while sparing A&#x003b2;<sub>40 </sub>levels. This novel GSM pharmacology is dose-responsive, driven by the plasma free-fraction of the compound and is capable of reducing both A&#x003b2;<sub>42 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>38 </sub>levels in APP over-expressing mice. Overall, SPI-1865 exemplifies the unique A&#x003b2; profile and good drug-like properties of SPI compounds, and further suggests they may be novel therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of SPI-1865 PK/PD studies in wild-type and transgenic mouse and wild-type rat</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Species and dosing regime</th><th align="center">Dose (mg/kg)</th><th align="center">Tissue</th><th align="center">Plasma exposure (&#x003bc;M)</th><th align="center">Brain exposure (&#x003bc;M)</th><th align="center">%A&#x003b2;38 lowering</th><th align="center">%A&#x003b2;40 lowering</th><th align="center">%A&#x003b2;42 lowering</th><th align="center">Collection time (hrs)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Wild-type rat single dose</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">Brain</td><td align="center">3.3 &#x000b1;

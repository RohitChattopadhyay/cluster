Screening for potential therapeutics in rodent models of AD has generally relied on testing compounds before pathology is present, thereby modeling disease prevention rather than disease modification. Furthermore, this approach to screening does not reflect the clinical presentation of AD patients which could explain the failure to translate compounds identified as beneficial in animal models to disease modifying compounds in clinical trials. Clearly a better approach to pre-clinical drug screening for AD is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To more accurately reflect the clinical setting, we used an alternative screening strategy involving the treatment of AD mice at a stage in the disease when pathology is already advanced. Aged (20-month-old) transgenic AD mice (APP/swePS1&#x00394;E9) were fed an exceptionally potent, orally active, memory enhancing and neurotrophic molecule called J147. Cognitive behavioral assays, histology, ELISA and Western blotting were used to assay the effect of J147 on memory, amyloid metabolism and neuroprotective pathways. J147 was also investigated in a scopolamine-induced model of memory impairment in C57Bl/6J mice and compared to donepezil. Details on the pharmacology and safety of J147 are also included.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Data presented here demonstrate that J147 has the ability to rescue cognitive deficits when administered at a late stage in the disease. The ability of J147 to improve memory in aged AD mice is correlated with its induction of the neurotrophic factors NGF (nerve growth factor) and BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) as well as several BDNF-responsive proteins which are important for learning and memory. The comparison between J147 and donepezil in the scopolamine model showed that while both compounds were comparable at rescuing short term memory, J147 was superior at rescuing spatial memory and a combination of the two worked best for contextual and cued memory.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>J147 is an exciting new compound that is extremely potent, safe in animal studies and orally active. J147 is a potential AD therapeutic due to its ability to provide immediate cognition benefits, and it also has the potential to halt and perhaps reverse disease progression in symptomatic animals as demonstrated in these studies.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the presence of both extracellular neuritic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Clinically, AD results in a progressive loss of cognitive ability as well as daily function activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. At the time when most patients are diagnosed with AD, the pathology is usually at an advanced stage. Currently approved therapies are only symptomatic in nature, providing modest improvements in memory without altering the progression of the disease pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, effective disease modifying treatments that also provide cognition benefits are urgently required.</p><p>Age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD, leading us to develop a drug discovery procedure that is based upon old-age-associated pathologies without requiring pre-selected molecular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A series of six cell culture assays was designed to mimic multiple old-age-associated pathways of central nervous system (CNS) nerve cell damage, and drug candidates were required to show efficacy in all of these assays before being moved forward into animals. As potential lead drug candidates, we generated a large number of derivatives of the curry spice curcumin, which is effective in AD transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based upon activity in multiple CNS toxicity assays, we identified an exceptionally potent, orally active, neurotrophic molecule called J147 that facilitates memory in normal rodents, and prevents the loss of synaptic proteins and cognitive decline when administered to three-month-old APP/swePS1&#x00394;E9 mice for seven months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The neurotrophic and memory-enhancing activities of J147 are associated with an increase in the level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) along with the expression of BDNF-responsive proteins, the enhancement of long term potentiation (LTP), synaptic protein preservation, the reduction of markers for oxidative stress and inflammation, the reduction of amyloid plaques, and lower levels of soluble A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>1-40. </sub>These combined neuroprotective and memory enhancing effects of a single molecule suggest that J147 has significant potential for the treatment of AD.</p><p>To more closely mimic the clinical setting, we have now examined the effect of J147 in transgenic mice at a stage when pathology is significantly advanced and asked if the drug could rescue some of the symptoms. This study used the well characterized APPswe/PS1&#x00394;E9 mouse model that exhibits a subset of behavioral and pathological features of AD, including age-dependent accumulation of beta-amyloid (A&#x003b2;) as well as learning and memory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This model was previously used to demonstrate the neuroprotective and memory enhancing effects of J147 when administered before pathology is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In comparison, the AD mice in this study were allowed to age to 20 months before being fed J147 for 3 months. We demonstrate that J147 has the ability to rescue the severe cognitive deficits present in aged, transgenic AD mice. In addition, J147 enhances the expression of BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) and additional proteins associated with their signaling pathways. Therefore, the reversal of cognitive deficits as well as some other aspects of AD pathology by J147 may result from an up-regulation of BDNF and NGF pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>High glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The line 85 mice carry two transgenes, the mouse/human chimeric APP/Swe, linked to Swedish FAD and human PS1&#x00394;E9. At 20 months of age both male and female transgenic mice were fed a high fat diet (Harlan Tekland, Madison, WI, USA) with and without J147 (200 ppm, 10 mg/kg/day). Treatment continued for three months and was followed by behavior testing and sacrifice of mice for tissue harvesting. Mouse body weights and food consumption were measured weekly, and there were no significant differences between the groups. (Data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>C57BL/6J mice-scopolamine study</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 60 male mice aged eight weeks were housed 4 per cage and were divided into five groups with 12 mice per group. Treatments were administered in the food (TestDiet<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>5015, Richmond, IN, USA) for a period of two weeks before commencement of behavioral testing. Groups included J147 at 200 ppm (10 mg/kg/day), donepezil at 20 ppm (1 mg/kg/day), a combination of J147 at 200 ppm and donepezil at 20 ppm, and two groups on the control food without any treatments. Following two weeks of treatment, memory impairment was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to each of the following behavioral tests: Y-maze, probe trial of the water maze and contextual and cued fear conditioning. Mice were allowed to rest for two days between each behavior test. All mice received scopolamine except for one of the control groups, which received saline as a control. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last behavioral test for tissue harvesting.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Behavior assays</title><sec><title>Two-day water maze</title><p>Spatial memory was determined using the two-day water maze in 23-month-old huAPPswe/PS1 transgenic mice fed J147 at 200 ppm in food for the previous three months. The protocol was adapted from a publication by Gulinello and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Water temperature remained at 27&#x000b0;C throughout the experiment. The goal platform was positioned 45 cm from the outside wall in the north-west quadrant of the maze for all groups and all trials. Day 1 of the two-day water maze procedure involved training the mice to find the platform using cues located around the pool within a 180 s time frame. This training involved a series of visible platform trials where mice were tracked using the Noldus EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technology, Inc., Leesburg, VA, USA). There were four visible platform trials (V1 to V4) where the last visible platform trial of a mouse was considered its post-habituation baseline. If the mice failed to find the platform after 180 s, they were placed on the platform by the experimenter. All mice remained on the platform for 15 s before being placed in a heated incubator (30&#x000b0;C) between trials. On Day 2, 24 hours following the last visible platform trial, mice were tested in a series of three hidden platform trials (T1 to T3). Again each trial lasted for 180 s. The time it took each mouse to find the hidden platform was measured as escape latency. For the scopolamine experiment, normal mice were given an i.p. injection of saline or 1 mg/kg scopolamine 30 minutes before the first hidden platform trial on Day 2. All trials were recorded using the EthoVision Software and statistics were computed using GraphPad Instat software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>The elevated plus maze analyzes the anxiety response of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This test relies upon the tendency of mice to have a fear of heights and to navigate towards dark enclosed spaces and remain there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our maze is made of gray plastic and consists of four arms (two open without walls and two enclosed by 15.25 cm high walls) 30 cm long and 5 cm wide in the shape of a plus sign. The elevated plus maze is placed close to the center of the room, and has similar levels of illumination on both open and closed arms. A video-tracking system (Noldus EthoVision) is used to automatically collect behavioral data. The software is installed on a PC computer with a digital video camera mounted overhead on the ceiling, which automatically detects and records when mice enter the open or closed arms of the maze and the time spent in each. Mice are habituated to the room 24 hours before testing. Mice are also habituated to the maze for two minutes before testing by placing them in the center of the maze and blocking entry to the arms. Mice were then tested in the maze for a five-minute period while the software tracked and recorded the behavior of the mice. The anxiety of mice was measured by comparing the time spent in the open arms to time spent in the closed arms. Statistics were computed using GraphPad Instat software.</p></sec><sec><title>Fear conditioning assay</title><p>Fear conditioning to either a cue or a context represents a form of associative learning. The read-out that is measured in contextual and cued fear conditioning is a freezing response that occurs following the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as a foot shock, with a conditioned stimulus (CS), such as a particular context or cue (tone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The mouse will freeze if it remembers and associates that environment with the aversive stimulus. The hippocampus and the amygdala are required for fear memory where the hippocampus is involved in the formation and retrieval of context fear associations and the amygdala is involved in conditioning and recall of associations to contextual and discrete cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This assay used fear conditioning chambers from Med Associates Inc. with Video Freeze Software (Med Associates Inc, St. Albans, VT, USA). On Day 1, mice were trained by allowing them to explore the chamber for 120 sec, mice were then presented with a 30-sec tone (2 kHz with 85 dB intensity) immediately followed by a 2-sec foot shock (0.7 mA). The tone-shock pairing was repeated following a 30-sec interval and the mice were again allowed to explore for 120 sec before removing them from the chamber. On Day 2, contextual memory, which requires a functioning hippocampus, was tested by placing the mice in the chambers and allowing them to explore for the same length of time as the previous day but without the tone and the shock. On Day 3, cued or emotional memory was tested, which relies on both hippocampus and amygdala. For this, the chamber environment was altered by using plastic boards to alter the shape of the chamber and using similar plastic boards over the grid floor to alter the environment further. Vanilla essence was used to alter the smell of the environment. Testing involved placing the mice in the chambers and carrying out the same paradigm as Day 1 without the foot shock. The camera measures the amount of time the mice freeze and the software allows analysis of this freezing at any time-point of interest. On Day 2, the time spent freezing is measured over the entire time in the chamber. A mouse that remembers the chamber context and associates it with the foot shock will spend more time freezing and this response is hippocampal dependent. The percentage of time spent freezing by each mouse is averaged per group and then groups can be compared and <italic>P</italic>-values calculated to determine statistical significance. On Day 3, the percentage of time spent freezing during the two tones is averaged per group, and then groups can be compared and <italic>P</italic>-values calculated to determine statistical significance. This result relates to the recall of associations to the tone and is dependent on the amygdala and the hippocampus. For the scopolamine experiment, normal mice were administered an i.p. injection of saline or 1 mg/kg scopolamine 30 minutes before testing on Day 2 and Day 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Y-Maze</title><p>Spontaneous alternation, the tendency to alternate free choices in a Y-maze (three arms), is a model for studying short term working memory in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mice were injected with 1 mg/kg of scopolamine or saline 30 minutes prior to testing. Then each mouse was placed in the center of the Y and arm entries were recorded by video camera and the order of entries were recorded for the first 15 entries. Spontaneous alternations are defined as consecutive triplets of different arm choices.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation and immunoblotting</title><p>Hippocampal and entorhinal cortex tissue samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% NP40) containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mg/ml each of pepstatin A, aprotinin, phosphoramidon, and leupeptin; 0.5 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; 1 mM EGTA; 5 mM fenvalerate; and 5 mM cantharidin).

Both conditioned medium from J147 treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, middle right panel) and NGF treated cells promoted neurite outgrowth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, top right panel), while control medium did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, top and middle left panels). This effect was reduced by anti-NGF anti-sera suggesting that J147 releases neurotrophins with an effect on neurites similar to those released by NGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, bottom panels). N2 media supplement, which contains transferrin, was added to this experiment to prevent a non-specific protein-mediated effect of antibody on neurite outgrowth.</p><p><italic>BDNF </italic>is a target gene of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). Following neuronal stimulation the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of CREB is increased. Furthermore, it is this activity-dependent increase that is believed to facilitate the transcription of proteins required for learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. CREB phosphorylation is also thought to limit inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Treatment of aged, transgenic huAPP/PS1 mice with J147 significantly increased the amount of phosphorylated CREB in the entorhinal cortex of these mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>) but not in the hippocampus (data not shown). The entorhinal cortex is one of the first areas to be affected in AD and is the main connection between the hippocampus and neocortex playing an important role in spatial memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. The entorhinal cortex contains the highest level of cholinergic innervations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] and in AD up to 80% of cholinergic axons can be depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Conner and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>] showed that NGF modulates cholinergic neuronal morphology and postulated that NGF acts by strengthening the cholinergic projections to the hippocampus and cortical areas, which consequently may alter neuronal plasticity and lead to improved memory. Therefore, the effect of J147 on the cholinergic system was investigated using the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine, which decreases central cholinergic neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec><title>J147 and donepezil in a scopolamine induced model of memory impairment</title><p>Cholinergic neurons are among the first to be lost in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>] and acetylcholine is the therapeutic target for most FDA approved drugs for AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. Since J147 increases NGF and NGF is a trophic factor required for cholinergic neurons, we asked if J147 is effective in an assay dependent upon cholinergic transmission. Scopolamine-induced memory impairment in rodents is a well established model of memory dysfunction based upon acetylcholine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. The available data suggest that reversal of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment is a viable model for predicting pharmacodynamic signals of cognition enhancing compounds in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, which transiently improves cognition in AD, reverses the cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine in both humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]. We compared J147 to donepezil in the scopolamine-induced memory impairment model using the same cognitive behavioral assays that were used for reversal of memory impairment in old AD mice. Mice were given J147 alone, donepezil alone and J147+donepezil in food before the cognitive behavioral assays, including the Y-maze, a two-day water maze and fear conditioning were done in the presence of scopolamine treatment. These assays have previously been used to probe deficits with scopolamine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>].</p><p>In all of the assays, mice received an i.p. injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg) 30 minutes before testing, while one of the groups on the control diet received an i.p. injection of saline. Mice were tested in the Y maze cognitive behavioral assay first. The spontaneous tendency to alternate free choices in entering the three arms of the Y maze is a measure of short-term working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Scopolamine-treated mice made a lower percentage of spontaneous alternations (defined as consecutive entries into the three different arms) in this test compared to saline controls and all three treatment groups returned this phenotype almost to control levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These data indicate that J147, donepezil and J147+donepezil all improve short-term working memory.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>J147 and donepezil in a scopolamine induced model of memory impairment</bold>.

Memory impairment was induced with scopolamine at 1 mg/kg 30 minutes before behavior testing in all groups except one of the control groups, which received saline as a control.

The scopolamine-treated mice took a considerable amount of time to find the hidden platform compared to saline controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Both J147 and the combination of J147+donepezil rescued this deficit in spatial memory created by scopolamine to a similar extent, but donepezil alone failed to rescue the deficit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, mice were tested in the fear conditioning behavioral assay. Mice were trained on Day 1 to associate their environment with an aversive stimulus (a foot shock). The amount of time spent freezing in response to the environment is measured on Day 2 as hippocampal dependent memory, whereas the amount of time spent freezing in response to the tone on Day 3 is related to hippocampus and amygdala function. The scopolamine-treated mice spent significantly less time freezing than saline controls in response to the context indicating they did not remember the environmental context (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). While J147 treatment did appear to slightly improve contextual memory compared to scopolamine, it was not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Donepezil did not improve memory with the mice showing freezing times similar to scopolamine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). However, the combination of J147+donepezil significantly improved memory compared to scopolamine suggesting a synergistic effect of the two compounds in this assay of hippocampal-dependent associative memory (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Scopolamine-treated mice also spent significantly less time freezing in response to the tone compared to saline controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

Blood and brain distribution of J147 following per oral (PO) administration was plotted for mice as a function of time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

The bioavailability of J147 following oral administration was calculated at 28%. The safety of J147 was evaluated using acute toxicity, the hERG assay, CYP450 3A4 assays and the Ames test, all of which were negative. Rats and mice received 2 g/kg of J147 to probe acute toxicity, yielding negative results (done by Absorption Systems (San Diego, CA, USA). In contrast, the oral LD<sub>50 </sub>in mice of the widely prescribed donepezil is 45 mg/kg (Pfizer, MSDS, Pfizer Inc, NY, NY, USA). A CeeTox assay also demonstrated "Safe" up to 90 mM J147 plasma concentration (done by CEETOX, Inc., Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and when J147 was fed at 10 mg/kg/day throughout pregnancy to mice, offspring were normal. MDRI-MDCK brain transport rates classified J147 as "High" (done by Absorption Systems), and there was moderate and symmetrical penetration in the Caco-2 assay (Absorption Systems). Additional de-risking and target identification screens were carried out at 10 &#x003bc;M J147 by various CROs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). No significant reproducible inhibition above 60% was observed except for monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) and the dopamine transporter. Dose response curves were done for each, yielding EC<sub>50</sub>s of 1.88 &#x003bc;M and 0.649 &#x003bc;M, respectively.

In this model, J147 maintained learning and memory, as well as synaptic proteins, and reduced biochemical markers of inflammation and soluble A&#x003b2; levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Over 200 compounds appear to alter A&#x003b2; metabolism or behavioral deficits in AD transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] but none have translated into AD therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>]. The reason for the lack of translation may be that many of these compounds are only effective when administered before pathology is present; yet, in humans, pathology is usually quite advanced at diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>To test the efficacy of J147 in a much more rigorous preclinical AD model, we treated mice using a therapeutic strategy more accurately reflecting the human symptomatic stage. Another mouse preclinical screening trial targeted the symptomatic stage (between 9 and 11 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and a study with a plant extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>] used 23- to 24-month-old mice, but to our knowledge no chemically defined AD drug candidate has been tried at the more pathologically advanced stage used in this study. Our strategy involved a 3-month J147 treatment in huAPP/PS1 transgenic AD mice aged to 20 months, an age in which severe behavioral deficits and AD pathology manifest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The goal was to investigate the ability of J147 to rescue cognitive impairment at a late stage in the disease as an indicator of its potential to rescue cognitive impairment in humans with AD. We report here a reversal of cognitive impairment in aged huAPP/PS1 mice by J147 and provide evidence that these beneficial effects are due to the ability of J147 to normalize several different aspects of AD pathology, likely through the up-regulation of the neurotrophin pathway.</p><p>Tests that assess distinct aspects of memory can be performed in rodents. Spatial memory is assessed using the Morris Water Maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>] and hippocampal-dependent associated memory is analyzed by using a fear conditioning assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>]. In addition, the anxiety response of rodents can be measured using the elevated plus maze, an assay in which AD mice show a disinhibition phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the AD reversal treatment strategy described here, J147 significantly improved several different aspects of memory affected in AD, including spatial memory, a disinhibition phenotype and hippocampal dependent associative learning (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>J147 treatment also resulted in a significant effect on A&#x003b2; metabolism, reducing levels of soluble A&#x003b2; without an effect on plaque density or size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This finding is important considering the accumulating evidence that soluble A&#x003b2; directly causes cognitive dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>] and the fact that improved cognition in 3xTg AD mice can manifest without a reduction in A&#x003b2; plaque load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>]. Our data (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) support this hypothesis. In addition, Zhang and colleagues observed that soluble A&#x003b2; is responsible for learning and memory deficits in the huAPP/PS1 mice used in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our data suggest that the reduction in soluble A&#x003b2; levels in the hippocampus of treated, aged AD mice compared to control AD mice by J147 is due to an effect on the APP processing pathway as J147 decreased the protein level of the BACE enzyme leading to an increase in APP levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, E</xref>).</p><p>J147 treatment of aged huAPP/PS1 mice increases the expression levels of several proteins involved in neurotrophin signaling. Members of the neurotrophin family maintain neuronal survival, axonal guidance and cell morphology and are key players in cognition and memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Neurotrophic factors are perturbed in AD and unevenly distributed due to impairment in axonal transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">105</xref>]. It is this imbalance in the AD brain that leads to the observed increase in proNGF in the hippocampus where it is synthesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>] and its reduction in the basal forebrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>]. NGF maintains and regulates the cholinergic phenotype of basal forebrain neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> shows that J147 decreases the ratio of pro- to mature NGF in the hippocampus, which is important given that proNGF is elevated in AD brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] and may lead to neuronal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. J147 may act to restore the balance between pro- and mature NGF which could allow transport of NGF to the basal forebrain neurons. Results from <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments with the neuronal HT22 cells also suggest an effect of J147 on NGF synthesis and secretion. J147 treatment of HT22 cells for one hour increased NGF mRNA by 2.8-fold in a DNA microarray experiment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and conditioned medium from J147 treated HT22 cells stimulated neurite growth in PC12 cells in a NGF-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>).</p><p><italic>BDNF</italic>, a target gene of CREB, is reduced with age and in the AD brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>] and is required for normal cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that J147 up-regulates the BDNF pathway in huAPP/PS1 mice following seven months of treatment, and here we show that even when administered at a stage when pathology is advanced, J147 can significantly increase two factors critical for memory formation: CREB phosphorylation and BDNF expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, respectively). An increase in both pro- and mature BDNF suggests an increase in BDNF synthesis and secretion from neurons while the decrease in the ratio of pro- to mature BDNF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) suggests higher levels of secreted BDNF. Further evidence for the up-regulation of BDNF signaling comes from the finding of increased levels of Homer-1 and Egr-3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E, F</xref>), which are genes activated by BDNF. Thus the phosphorylation of CREB by J147 could increase the levels of BDNF, which consequently may increase BDNF responsive proteins. Hippocampal levels of both BDNF and NGF have been correlated with cognitive performance in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>] and administration of these neurotrophic factors reduces memory loss in aging or animal models of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>], further substantiating their importance for memory. The effect of J147 on both NGF and BDNF levels reported here, as well as its effect on BDNF target genes, may explain the memory deficit reduction observed in the aged huAPP/PS1mice treated with J147 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Neurotrophic factors have been pursued as appealing candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, neuropathies and peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">118</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">119</xref>]. However, delivering growth factors to the brain has proved difficult and risky for patients with significant side effects observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>], such as sprouting of sensory and sympathetic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">121</xref>], and neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]. Treatment strategies involving neurotrophic factors are now based on the transfer of genes, molecules or cells into the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>]. NGF is in fact viewed as a viable target for AD clinical trials with one group investigating NGF <italic>ex vivo </italic>gene delivery in a Phase 1 trial with human patients aimed at stimulating cholinergic function and improving memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>]. This small study found improvement in the rate of cognitive decline but the procedure requires delivery directly into the brain. Perhaps, a molecule that could stimulate neurotrophic factors, such as NGF <italic>in vivo</italic>, would be more efficient, more safe and cost effective than gene delivery directly into the brain.</p><p>Scopolamine is a well known competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist that causes reproducible, transient impairments across multiple cognitive domains in healthy animals and non-diseased humans by decreasing central cholinergic neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">124</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>]. The ability of compounds to reverse scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment is used as a model for demonstrating drug target engagement and cognitive enhancement in both humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. In this study, we utilized the scopolamine model to compare J147 to donepezil, the currently most widely used AD drug. Three different behavioral assays, Y-maze, two-day water maze and fear conditioning, which have previously been used to assay deficits with scopolamine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] compared the ability of compounds to reverse cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine. All three assays demonstrated cognitive deficits with scopolamine treatment compared to saline controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-D</xref>). Results from the treatment groups revealed that all three groups, J147, donepezil and J147+donepezil, rescued the decrease in spontaneous alternations induced by scopolamine demonstrating an improvement in short-term working memory (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). J147 and J147 + donepezil rescued the deficit in spatial navigational memory caused by scopolamine in the water maze but donepezil alone failed to rescue the deficit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In the fear conditioning paradigm, only the combination of J147 and donepezil rescued the hippocampal-dependent deficit in contextual and cued fear conditioning, suggesting the compounds' synergistic effect for this particular type of memory (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>). Demonstration of synergism between the two compounds may be important for clinical trials as the majority of patients recruited to a trial will likely already be on donepezil treatment.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of J147 after a single dose of 20 mg/kg in mice show brain levels of about 600 nM at 2 h, over 10-fold above its EC<sub>50 </sub>in some cell culture neuroprotection assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], with a brain to blood ratio of approximately 0.5. The bioavailability of J147 following PO administration in mice was calculated at 28%. Positive data for blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration (High) were also obtained for J147 using the MDCK-MDRI cell culture model for assaying the BBB penetration potential of drugs. Acute toxicity studies showed no oral toxicity of J147 in mice at the maximum testable dose of 2 gm/kg and other safety tests including hERG, CYP450 inhibition and Ames were also negative which further supports the safety of J147. In the search for the target of J147, many potential off target effects have been ruled out (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), once again suggesting the safety of J147. The data collected to date suggest that J147 has good pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the range of biological activities of J147 relevant to human AD is quite extensive. When administered in food at a stage when pathology is advanced in 20-month-old transgenic AD mice, J147 rescued the severe loss of cognitive function, reduced soluble levels of A&#x003b2; and increased neurotrophic factors essential for memory. When compared to donepezil in memory assays, J147 performed equally well or superior, and even showed synergistic effects in the fear conditioning assay. In addition, J147 has good medicinal chemical and pharmacological properties for a CNS drug, has few off-target effects and is orally active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, J147 is an exciting, new compound with strong potential to be an AD therapeutic by slowing disease progression through neuroprotection as well as providing rapid cognition benefits by reversing cognition deficits following short-term treatment. These dual attributes improve the chances for success in clinical trials as a disease-modifying drug, and seems ideally suited for rapid progress through the new FDA guidelines for AD trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">126</xref>]. We hypothesize that the mechanism of action of J147 is related to its ability to increase the levels of BDNF and NGF, and studies are being conducted to identify its molecular target.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>A&#x003b2;: beta-amyloid; AD: Alzheimer's disease; APP: amyloid precursor protein; BACE: &#x003b2;-secretase; BBB: blood brain barrier; BDNF: brain derived neurotrophic factor; CM: conditioned medium; CNS: central nervous system; CREB: cyclic AMP response element binding protein; CROs: contract research organizations; CS: conditioned stimulus; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium; Egr: early growth response; ESI: electrospray ionization; Hz: Herz; i.p.: intraperitoneal; KPBS: sucrose-potassium-PBS; LCMS: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; LTP: long term potentiation; MAO B: monoamine oxidase B; MS: mass spectrometry; NGF: nerve growth factor; NMR: nuclear magnetic resonance; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; ppm: parts per million; PSD: postsynaptic density; TBAB: tetra-<italic>n</italic>-butylammonium bromide; TLC: thin layer chromatography; TMS: tetramethylsilane; US: unconditioned stimulus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The Salk Institute is applying for patents on J147.

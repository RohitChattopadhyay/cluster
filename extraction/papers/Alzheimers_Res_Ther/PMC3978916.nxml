Histopathologically, AD is characterised by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and amyloid-beta (A&#x003b2;) plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The extent of these histopathological features is considered to vary with and to determine clinical disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. While the initiating pathogenic events underlying AD are still debated, there is strong evidence to suggest that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have important roles in the neurodegenerative cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, it has been proposed that targeting mitochondrial dysfunction could prove valuable for AD therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>One safe, simple yet effective approach to the repair of damaged mitochondria is photobiomodulation with near-infrared light (NIr). This treatment, which involves the irradiation of tissue with low intensity light in the red to near-infrared wavelength range (600 to 1000&#x000a0;nm), was originally pioneered for the healing of superficial wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] but has been recently shown to have efficacy in protecting the central nervous system. While the mechanism of action remains to be elucidated, there is evidence that NIr preserves and restores cellular function by reversing dysfunctional mitochondrial cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX) activity, thereby mitigating the production of reactive oxygen species and restoring ATP production to normal levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>To date, NIr treatment has yielded neuroprotective outcomes in animal models of retinal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], Parkinson&#x02019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, NIr therapy has yielded beneficial outcomes in clinical trials of human patients with mild to moderate stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This treatment represents a promising alternative to drug therapy because it is safe, easy to apply and has no known side-effects at levels even higher than optimal doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of NIr in mitigating the brain pathology and associated cellular damage that characterise AD. We utilised two mouse models, each manifesting distinct AD-related pathologies: the K3 tau transgenic model, which develops NFTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; and the APP/PS1 transgenic model, which develops amyloid plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Here, we present histochemical evidence that NIr treatment over a period of 1 month reduces the severity of AD-related pathology and oxidative stress and restores mitochondrial function in brain regions susceptible to neurodegeneration in AD, specifically the neocortex and hippocampus. The findings extend our previous NIr work in models of acute neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] to demonstrate that NIr is also effective in protecting the brain against chronic insults due to AD-related genetic aberrations, a pathogenic mechanism that is likely to more closely model the human neurodegenerative condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse models</title><p>The K3 transgenic mouse model, originally generated as a model of frontotemporal dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], harbours a human tau gene with the pathogenic K369I mutation; expression is driven by the neuron-specific mThy1.2 promoter. This model manifests high levels of hyperphosphorylated tau and NFTs by 2 to 3 months of age and cognitive deficits by about 4 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We commenced our experiments on K3 mice and matched C57BL/6 wildtype (WT) controls at 5 months of age, when significant neuropathology is already present.</p><p>The APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model, obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Stock number 004462; Bar Harbor, ME, USA), harbours two human transgenes: the amyloid beta precursor protein gene (APP) containing the Swedish mutation; and the presenilin-1 gene (PS1) containing a deletion of exon 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The APP/PS1 mice exhibit increased A&#x003b2; and amyloid plaques by 4 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and cognitive deficits by 6 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We commenced our experiments on APP/PS1 mice and matched C57BL/6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;C3H WT controls at 7 months of age, when numerous amyloid plaques and associated cognitive deficits are present.</p><p>Genotyping of mice was achieved by extracting DNA from tail tips through a modified version of the Hot Shot preparation method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and amplifying the transgene sequence by polymerase chain reaction. As reported previously, K3 mice were identified using the primers 5&#x02032;-GGGTGTCTCCAATGCCTGCTTCTTCAG-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-AAGTCACCCAGCAGGGAGGTGCTCAG-3&#x02032; (reverse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and APP/PS1 mice were genotyped using primers 5&#x02032;-AGGACTGACCACTCGACCAG-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-CGGGGGTCTAGTTCTGCAT-3&#x02032; (reverse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>For each series of experiments on K3 mice (aged 5 months) or APP/PS1 mice (aged 7 months) there were three experimental groups: untreated WT mice, untreated transgenic mice and NIr-treated transgenic mice (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 mice per experimental group for the K3 series, 15 mice in total; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 mice per experimental group for the APP/PS1 series, 18 mice in total). Our design did not include a WT control group exposed to NIr because NIr has no detectable impact on the survival and function of cells in normal healthy brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given the consistency of the previous results, use of animals for this extra control group did not seem justified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Mice in the NIr-treated groups were exposed to one 90-second&#x000a0;cycle of NIr (670&#x000a0;nm) from a light-emitting device (LED) (WARP 10; Quantum Devices, Barneveld, WI, USA) for 5 days per week over 4 consecutive weeks. Light energy emitted from the LED during each 90-second treatment equates to 4 Joule/cm<sup>2</sup>; a total of 80 Joule/cm<sup>2</sup> was delivered to the skull over the 4 weeks. Our measurements of NIr penetration across the fur and skull of a C57BL/6 mouse indicate that ~2.5% of transmitted light reaches the cortex.</p><p>For each treatment, the mouse was restrained by hand and the LED was held 1 to 2&#x000a0;cm above the head. The LED light generated no heat and reliable delivery of the radiation was achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For the sham-treated WT, K3 and APP/PS1 groups, animals were restrained in the same way and the device was held over the head, but the light was not switched on. This treatment regime is similar to that used in previous studies where beneficial changes to neuropathology and behavioural signs were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Experimental animals were housed two or more to a cage and kept in a 12-hour light (&#x0003c;5 lux)/dark cycle at 22&#x000b0;C; food pellets and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>At the end of the experimental period, mice were anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60&#x000a0;mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Brains were post fixed for 3 hours, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline. Tissue was embedded in OCT compound (ProSciTech, Thuringowa, QLD, Australia) and coronal sections of the neocortex and the hippocampus (between bregma &#x02212;1.8 and &#x02212;2.1) were cut at 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m thickness on a Leica cryostat (Nussloch, Germany).</p><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For most antibodies, antigen retrieval was achieved using sodium citrate buffer with 0.1% Triton. Sections were blocked in 10% normal goat serum and then incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with a mouse monoclonal antibody &#x02013; paired helical filaments-tau AT8, 1:500 (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium); 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 1:200 (JaICA, Fukuroi, Shizuoka, Japan); 8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG), 1:200 (JaICA); COX, 1:200 (MitoSciences, Eugene, OR, USA) &#x02013; and/or a rabbit polyclonal antibody (200&#x000a0;kDa neurofilament, 1:500; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Sections were then incubated for 3 hours at room temperature in Alexa Fluor-488 (green) and/or Alexa Fluor-594 (red) tagged secondary antibodies specific to host species of the primary antibodies (1:1,000; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sections were then counterstained for nuclear DNA with bisbenzimide (Sigma).</p><p>Two different but complementary antibodies were used to label A&#x003b2; peptide: 6E10, which recognises residues 1 to 16; and 4G8, which recognises residues 17 to 24. We have previously used these two antibodies in combination to validate A&#x003b2; labelling, demonstrating identical labelling patterns in the rat neocortex and hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For double labelling using 6E10 antibodies (1:500; Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA) and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies (1:1,000; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), antigen retrieval was achieved by incubation in 90% formic acid for 10 minutes, and primary antibody incubation was carried out overnight at room temperature. For labelling using the 4G8 (1:500; Covance) antibody, slides were treated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 50% methanol, incubated in 90% formic acid and then washed several times in dH<sub>2</sub>O before the blocking step, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. After blocking, sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with 4G8 antibody. Sections were then incubated in biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 hour followed by ExtrAvidin peroxidase for 2.5&#x000a0;hours. The sections were then washed and developed with 3,3&#x02032;-Diaminobenzidine.</p><p>Negative control sections were processed in the same fashion as described above except that primary antibodies were omitted. These control sections were immunonegative. Fluorescent images were taken using a Zeiss Apotome 2, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany.

Briefly, sections were placed in prewarmed 10% silver nitrate solution for 15 minutes, washed and then placed in ammonium silver nitrate solution at 40&#x000b0;C for a further 30 minutes. Sections were subsequently developed for 1 minute and then transferred to 1% ammonium hydroxide solution for 1 minute to stop the reaction. Sections were then washed in dH<sub>2</sub>O, placed in 5% sodium thiosulphate solution for 5 minutes, washed, cleared and mounted in dibutyl phathalate xylene.</p><p>As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], A&#x003b2; plaques were studied by staining with Congo red, a histological dye that binds preferentially to compacted amyloid with a &#x003b2;-sheet secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Briefly, sections were treated with 2.9&#x000a0;M sodium chloride in 0.01&#x000a0;M NaOH for 20 minutes and were subsequently stained in filtered alkaline 0.2% Congo red solution for 1 hour.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Morphological analysis</title><sec><title>Staining intensity and area measurements</title><p>To quantify the average intensity and area of antibody labelling within the neocortex and hippocampal regions, an integrated morphology analysis was undertaken using MetaMorph software. For each section, the level of nonspecific staining (using an adjacent region of unstained midbrain) was adjusted to a set level to ensure a standard background across different groups. Next, outlines of retrosplenial cortex area 29 and hippocampal CA1 region were traced and the average intensity and area of immunostaining were calculated by the program. Measurements were conducted on &#x02265;4 representative sections per animal and &#x02265;3 animals per experimental group. Statistical analyses were performed in Prism 5.0 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA, USA) using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey&#x02019;s multiple comparison post test.

The software was programmed to measure the number of plaques and the average size of plaques after thresholding for colour. The percentage of area covered by plaques (plaque burden) was calculated by multiplying the number of plaques by the average size of plaques, divided by the area of interest, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The average number of Congo red-positive plaques in the APP/PS1 brain regions was estimated using the optical fractionator method (StereoInvestigator; MBF Science, Williston, VT, USA), as outlined previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

Further, the extent of mitigation &#x02013; to levels less than at the start of treatment &#x02013; suggests that NIr can reverse some elements of AD-related pathology.</p><p>The present results add to our previous findings of NIr-induced neuroprotection in models of toxin-induced acute neurodegeneration (that is, MPTP-induced parkinsonism). When incorporated into the growing body of evidence that NIr can also protect against CNS damage in models of stroke, traumatic brain injury and retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the findings provide a basis for trialling NIr treatment as a strategy for protection against neurodegeneration from a range of causes. Present evidence is based on the use of multiple methods, immunohistochemical and histological, to demonstrate pathological features (for example, 4G8 antibody labelling and Congo red staining for amyloid plaques, AT8 antibody labelling and Bielschowsky silver staining for NFTs).</p><sec><title>Relationship to previous studies</title><p>The present study focused on pathological features considered characteristic of AD, as well as on signs of cellular damage (for example, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction) that have been demonstrated in AD and in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our observations in the K3 strain add to previous studies by providing the first evidence in this strain of extensive oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Our findings are consistent with previous reports of the effects of red to infrared light on AD pathology in animal models. De Taboada and colleagues assessed the capacity of 808&#x000a0;nm laser-sourced infrared radiation, delivered three times per week over 6 months, to reduce pathology in an APP transgenic model of A&#x003b2; amyloidosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Treatment led to a reduction in plaque number, amyloid load and inflammatory markers, an increase in ATP levels and mitochondrial function, and mitigation of behavioural deficits. De Taboada and colleagues commenced treatment at 3 months of age, before the expected onset of amyloid pathology and cognitive effects. Similarly, Grillo and colleagues reported that 1,072&#x000a0;nm infrared light, applied 4 days per week for 5 months, reduces AD-related pathology in another APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model (TASTPM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These investigators also initiated light treatment before the onset of pathology, at 2 months of age. Both studies thus provide evidence that infrared radiation can slow the progression of cerebral degeneration in these models. The present results confirm these observations, in two distinct transgenic strains; they also confirm that the wound-healing and neuroprotective effects of red-infrared length do not vary qualitatively with wavelength, over a wide range.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence of reversal of pathology</title><p>Previous reports have described the natural history of the K3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and APP/PS1 transgenic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Based on these previous reports and our own baseline data (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), significant brain pathology and functional deficits are present in both models at the ages when we commenced treatment. Our results therefore suggest that significant reversal of pathology has been induced by the NIr treatment. This has implications for clinical practice, where most patients are not diagnosed until pathogenic mechanisms have already been initiated and resultant neurologic symptoms manifest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>This evidence that AD-related neuropathology can be transient &#x02013; appear then disappear &#x02013; is not novel. Garcia-Alloza and colleagues described evidence of the transient deposition of A&#x003b2;, including the formation of plaque-like structures, in a transgenic model of A&#x003b2; deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Reversal of such pathology, by interventions such as NIr treatment, may therefore be possible. However our results suggest that reversal may also be limited to recently formed, immature plaques, as we observed a significant NIr-induced reduction in immunolabelling with the 4G8 and 6E10 antibodies but no significant difference in Congo red staining. Because the 4G8 and 6E10 antibodies recognise various forms of A&#x003b2;, while Congo red stains only mature, compacted plaques, a reasonable deduction is that NIr treatment reduces only the transient, recently formed A&#x003b2; deposits, with no substantial effect on mature plaques. As there is still no consensus as to the pathogenic roles of different forms of A&#x003b2;, it is unclear how this might impact on the therapeutic potential of NIr in a clinical setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective actions of red to infrared light are not completely understood. There is considerable evidence that NIr photobiomodulation enhances mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis by activating photoacceptors such as COX and increasing electron transfer in the respiratory chain, while also reducing harmful reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. NIr photobiomodulation could also upregulate protective factors such as nerve growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] that could target specific areas of degeneration.</p><p>The ability of NIr to reduce the expression of hyperphosphorylated tau, which in turn reduces oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], may be key to its neuroprotective effect. Oxidative stress and free radicals increase the severity of cerebrovascular lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], oligomerisation of A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and tauopathies and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] in AD. Considering the brain&#x02019;s high consumption of oxygen and consequent susceptibility to oxidative stress, mitigating such stressors would probably have a pronounced protective effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our results in two transgenic mouse models with existing AD-related pathology suggest that low-energy NIr treatment can reduce characteristic pathology, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in susceptible regions of the brain. These results, when taken together with those in other models of neurodegeneration, strengthen the notion that NIr is a viable neuroprotective treatment for a range of neurodegenerative conditions. We believe this growing body of work provides the impetus to begin trialling NIr treatment as a broad-based therapy for AD and other neurodegenerations.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>A&#x003b2;: Amyloid-beta; AD: Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; APP: Amyloid beta precursor protein gene; COX: Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase; 4-HNE: 4-hydroxynonenal; LED: Light-emitting diode; NFT: Neurofibrillary tangle; NIr: Near-infrared light; 8-OHDG: 8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine; PS1: Presenilin 1; WT: Wildtype.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SP undertook the bulk of the experimental work and analysis and wrote the manuscript.
